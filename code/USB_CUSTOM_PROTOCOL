Custom USB protocol to communicate with the dmx adapter and all input modules.
All USB connected arduinos are kind of mixed together on the rpi.
At startup, the pi connects all arduinos and listens for the startbyte.
After receiving that, the arduino connects the arduinos depending on the previous mapping.
The rpi programm might be restarted, so the rpis keep sending theyr startbyte indefinetely.
The startbytes are

1 -> DMX Adapter
2 -> Color Module

The DMX Adapter wont send anything else, but all input modules send keystrokes or other commands each in two bytes.
First the id byte of the key and then instructions, if it is pressed or, in case of a poti, at what value it stands.
When the arduino receives a known id byte, it waits for the corresponding data byte for that key.
ID bytes and possible values are
(1 = pressed, 0 = released, 0-255 = poti values)

20 -> Color change to RED (1)
21 -> Color change to ORANGE (1)
22 -> Color change to VIOLET (1)
23 -> Color change to BLUE (1)
24 -> Color change to GREEN (1)
25 -> Color change to YELLOW (1)
26 -> Color change to WHITE (1)
27 -> Color change to Turquise (1)
28 -> Color change to PINK (1)
29 -> Color change to RAINBOW (1)
30 -> Color transition (duration) INTELLIGENT / ANIMATIVE (1/0)
31 -> Color transition (duration) SPEED (0-255)
